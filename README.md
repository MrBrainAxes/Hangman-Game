# Hangman-Game
Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes.[1] This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.
A version which incorporated hanging imagery was described in a 1902 Philadelphia Inquirer article, which stated that it was popular at "White Cap" parties hosted by "Vigilance Committees" where guests would wear "white peaked caps with masks"
